## Password Queries

* Simple query using `<cat>/<ident>` for a category and identifier
* Ability to query on any field or metadata
* Multiple query parameters

## Commands

* Less crappy syntax for `new`
  - Also ability to generate a password
  - Or prompt (twice) for a password
* Modify password
  - Prompt for new one
  - Generate new one
* Modify record data
* Edit record data (in $EDITOR)
* Edit whole database (in $EDITOR)
  - This is dangerous... should make sure the file is correct syntax before
    replacing the old one
